Learning the python library numpy

## What is numpy?
Numpy is a python library which is used to make multidimentional arrays.

## Why use numpy over the inbuilt lists?
numpy represents a single int as a 4 byte integer, whereas inbuilt lists store ints as 4 pieces of info - object value, object type, reference count and size. The first 3 are represented by 8 bytes each and the size is represented by 4 bytes. 
<br />
numpy is faster because it doesn't have to check the type of each element as each array stores only one type and stores values using less space. Memory is also stored in one place in numpy, while its scattered in lists.
<br />
numpy also has more methods than normal lists.

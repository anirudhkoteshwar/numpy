Learning the python library numpy

## What is numpy?
Numpy is a python library which is used to make multidimentional arrays.

## Why use numpy over the inbuilt lists?
numpy represents a single int as a 4 byte integer, whereas inbuilt lists store ints as 4 pieces of info - object value, object type, reference count and size. The first 3 are represented by 8 bytes each and the size is represented by 4 bytes. 
<br />
numpy is faster because it is strongly typed and stores values using less space.
